Website philosophy:

- This is a static website made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- No external libraries or pre-made code is used in this, everything is written by me.
- The end-goal is to achieve a handy website that is useful and well made while being unique.

For these reasons I probably wont accept contributions, as using someone else code would defeat the purpose.
